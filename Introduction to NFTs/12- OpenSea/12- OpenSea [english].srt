1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,990
We reach the final stretch.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,590
How do we spell and distribute an nft?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,890
Here you see open?

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,390
See a website to discover collect them selves,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,790
extraordinary entities.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,790
It's one of the largest nft marketplaces available and

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,290
to simplify the process to entry without needing to build

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,689
your own smart contract.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,889
Deploy your own code,

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,889
learn how to code.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,790
And all of that in-between.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,490
We're going to use Open Sea to create our own

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,690
mfp.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,890
But you will need an aetherium wallet to use

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,390
open sea.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,990
And so,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,490
like we said,

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,290
aetherium is powering a lot of the energy market and

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,590
if these are in huge demand and open sea is

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,090
a Marketplace that built on top of aetherium to make

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,790
it easy for you to sell distribute and even by

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,990
your own interpeace.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,990
Now,

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,190
we're going to go specifically through how to open your

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,990
own wallet and sell on the Open Sea.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,289
Let's get start.
