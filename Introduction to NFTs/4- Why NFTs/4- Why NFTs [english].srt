1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,390
Now that we know what,

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,490
and if these are right and what the difference is

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,790
between a fungible and a non-fungible asset.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,190
We can definitely have to ask her a question.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,790
Why,

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,690
why do we need?

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,490
And if peace to do anything at all?

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,590
What is the purpose of a saying?

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:18,990
Okay.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,889
Well,

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,290
we know what,

12
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,490
a fungible acid as we know what a non-fungible asset

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:22,689
is,

14
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,990
but why do we need these tokens to Define ownership,

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,590
right?

16
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,790
And,

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,389
you know,

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,490
at the end of the day,

19
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,389
that's a great question.

20
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,889
So,

21
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,990
let's talk about purpose,

22
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,390
right?

23
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,990
Let's talk about purpose in a digital world in the

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,690
digital world ownership was never clearly defined.

25
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,890
What I mean by this was never clearly defined honestly,

26
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:47,990
like,

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,490
when I bought something,

28
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,890
I knew I was the owner of it yet.

29
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,490
You knew,

30
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,390
but was it public?

31
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,590
Did you have the sole rights to that item?

32
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,190
Is it traceable?

33
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,590
Write all of those things just like,

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,089
only a watch.

35
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,289
I know that's my watch.

36
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,390
I know that I bought that watch.

37
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,390
Therefore.

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,589
That is my watch,

39
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,890
right.

40
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,289
Yeah,

41
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,789
but like,

42
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,390
what actually makes it your watch is it tracked in

43
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,190
the database somewhere?

44
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,690
Does Rolex keep a database of the serial number against

45
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:19,890
the,

46
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,789
the person who bought it?

47
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,390
Maybe they do,

48
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,490
maybe they do a knuckleball Define ownership,

49
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:23,990
right?

50
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,890
The serial codes often do the fine order ship,

51
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,990
but only if their track against the purchaser.

52
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,690
So,

53
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,589
in a digital world,

54
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,490
Do we get serial codes on things?

55
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:35,990
Well,

56
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,289
think of a time,

57
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,890
where you bought a domain name,

58
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,589
a game skin,

59
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,890
a ticket,

60
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,490
right?

61
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,089
Just purchasing online in general makes all the difference in

62
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,289
the world.

63
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,690
Because,

64
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,190
you know,

65
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,589
you're purchasing a domain name is very traceable.

66
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:52,890
Right?

67
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,589
Like I cannot is tracking this person bought it and

68
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,990
we have whoisguard.

69
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,190
So there is a database tracking,

70
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,490
who is the rightful owner of the domain name.

71
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,390
Can I resell it?

72
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,490
Not really.

73
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:06,990
Well,

74
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,590
I can resell my domain,

75
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,690
but there's no real mechanism for it.

76
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,790
It's more.

77
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,090
So a transferability aspect and then someone,

78
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,890
you know,

79
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,790
pays me for.

80
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,890
There's no real on my mechanism that really warms fat

81
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,590
in a easy-to-use way.

82
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,090
Think of a game skin.

83
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,190
Have you ever played fortnite?

84
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,790
Although you buy that skin,

85
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,690
you know what,

86
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,390
it's linked to your account.

87
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,190
Therefore.

88
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,890
There is a form of ownership,

89
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,490
right?

90
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,390
A certain form.

91
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,490
But can I go and resell it on eBay?

92
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,090
Can I take that skin?

93
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,490
And you don't turn a profit?

94
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,590
It's quite difficult to ask a question.

95
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,390
Do you actually own it?

96
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,190
And ownership means that you can freely resell the good.

97
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,590
You own.

98
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,190
Right,

99
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,790
it does mean that,

100
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,190
right?

101
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,390
Like,

102
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,490
if I own something like,

103
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,290
if I buy a watch,

104
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,490
I have the physical good.

105
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,290
I go to a store,

106
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,890
I say,

107
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:02,990
hey,

108
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,690
how much and they give me money and I give

109
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,290
them the watch.

110
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,090
If I buy a game skin online on fortnite or

111
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,490
whatever other game,

112
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,790
you may play doesn't have to be 49,

113
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,890
but any game at all,

114
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,090
it's really difficult to resell it.

115
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,190
Like I can't just going for the price tag on

116
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,290
it.

117
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,490
Now,

118
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,190
there were certain games in the past that allowed this

119
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,390
ability of reselling skins,

120
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,590
right?

121
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,090
There was a csgo stuff that went on in there

122
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,090
have been ways of doing this,

123
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,690
right?

124
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,390
But all of those ways,

125
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,290
we're kind of proprietary like they weren't unified think of

126
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,690
it like this.

127
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,690
A market place to sell these digital things was usually

128
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,690
built custom to the asset.

129
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,690
That was being sold for the 10 unified way to

130
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,890
track ownership of any digital good whatsoever,

131
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,090
doesn't matter what it is.

132
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,390
And that exactly is what.

133
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,290
And if keys are trying to solve the right to

134
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,990
ownership the right to resell,

135
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,690
and they're enabling that through different mechanisms in those mechanisms

136
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,590
will talk about.

137
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,390
But the why of entities the why is the ownership

138
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,190
part the ownership of being very strict and through that

139
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,390
ownership enabling ways to clearly Define that

140
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,890
resale ability.

141
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,990
Because when we ask ourselves,

142
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,890
what's my proof today?

143
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,190
Is it an email?

144
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,690
Is it like a thread is the serial number?

145
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,490
Yeah,

146
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,790
maybe maybe it's all of those things.

147
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,590
But is it publicly traced?

148
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,090
No?

149
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,190
Is it clear know and all those questions?

150
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,490
All those problems are what NFP as a technology is

151
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,190
trying to solve know if we take nft as a

152
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,490
technology,

153
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,990
right?

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,790
Just don't brawl technology like the concept of an if

155
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,590
keep the token that represents the non-fungible item.

156
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,190
That is the y,

157
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,190
That's the ownership part and then through concept we

158
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,890
get into.

159
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,790
All right,

160
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,490
how do I enable that?

161
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,890
And that's when we enter blockchain a decentralized ledger,

162
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,490
right?

163
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,590
Blockchain technology again,

164
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,390
a technology that enables other Concepts other Technologies to build

165
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,190
upon it.

166
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,890
And that's what most men on.

167
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,790
But what I want to end on is that the

168
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,590
why of non-fungible tokens is for that proof of ownership

169
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,190
and through that proof of ownership,

170
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,690
having that Tolkien being able to say,

171
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,290
I own this asset and being able to enable me.

172
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,190
Places,

173
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,890
treatability,

174
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,690
resale ability.

175
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,190
All of those things we can do that now because

176
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,590
the concept is there,

177
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,990
a generic concept not a proprietary concept where Call of

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,790
Duty has its own Marketplace and fortnite has its own

179
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,390
Marketplace.

180
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,790
That means every company needs to build their own proprietary

181
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,590
system.

182
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,990
And if these enable a generic system that everyone can

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,790
build upon doesn't matter what company,

184
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,490
leverage the generic blockchain technology and enable resale ability without

185
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,390
needing to build all of the systems in a closed-off

186
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,990
way.
