1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,190
Now that we have a collection and we have it

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,290
all set up with everything that we need.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,590
Right?

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,990
We have our own personal profile does eating profile.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,590
We now have a collection on the market place.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,990
The collection on the market place,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,590
isn't the end of Kezia.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,689
It's just Open,

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,689
Seas way of pulling together.

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,689
All of the items that you want on there.

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,590
What you would call a project.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:22,790
So,

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,590
your art pieces,

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,790
you can put in different collection if you wanted to

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,790
make specific elections for specific things.

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,490
So now let's go ahead and add an item over

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:31,689
here.

18
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,490
You can see the create a new item form.

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,790
This is where open allows us to actually,

20
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,890
upload our image or video or MP3,

21
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,090
whatever the case may be.

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,790
And so,

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,490
what we're going to upload is our very first,

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,790
and if he does etm biker,

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,090
and we're going to call him this etm biker.

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,390
So here you can see the uploaded you can do,

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,890
jpg,

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,190
PNG,

29
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,690
GIF,

30
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,790
SVG MP3 all of the above.

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,489
And if you have a project externally,

32
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,890
right?

33
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,990
If you have a bigger project where you have a

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,990
website with all the information on the art,

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,990
you're trying to make you can link the specific item

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,089
with extra information so that they can go view your

37
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,890
project.

38
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,890
Now over here,

39
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,190
you can fill in the description here will fill in

40
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,990
the very first ztm,

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,890
nft.

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,890
Ztm biker.

43
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,890
And then we'll add it to the collection 02 Mastery.

44
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,289
Cuz that's the only connection we have.

45
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:34,690
And here,

46
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,390
you can see that.

47
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,890
You can add properties to it,

48
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,490
right?

49
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,890
You get out of properties,

50
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,789
like character age,

51
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,890
all that stuff.

52
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,890
So what we're going to do is we'll give it

53
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,190
a character.

54
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,690
But we're going to call the character number one,

55
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,589
cuz the very first NFL team.

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,390
Can get a level,

57
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,390
we can give its that,

58
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,190
you could even give it unlock.

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,990
Apple content,

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,890
unlockable content being specific,

61
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,589
access key,

62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,390
and email something to contact someone or a specific item

63
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,990
code that you could redeem for something and who knows?

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,990
Maybe we'll put something in here.

65
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,590
So that's where you can put unlockable content.

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,590
Next to that you can mark it as explicit content

67
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,390
just in case.

68
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,390
It's not for young people and you can determine on

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,190
what blockchain.

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,590
So open see supports aetherium and polygon polygon is a

71
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,190
gas free.

72
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,190
Block Chain experience that works with aetherium.

73
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,890
So you can determine on which chain you basically want

74
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,690
to sell it and then once you hit create you

75
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,190
created,

76
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,090
But once you hit create,

77
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,090
it actually goes through the process of creating your nft

78
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,090
on the Open Sea platform.

79
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,690
Now at that point it had been distributed to the

80
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,590
marketplace just yet.

81
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,090
It just says you created the ztm biker.
