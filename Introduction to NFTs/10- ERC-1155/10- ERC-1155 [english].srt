1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,090
The next standard,

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,190
you need to know about him.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,190
Maybe the final standard is ERC 1155.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,690
It was coined the final standard for any of these

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,190
on his hair.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,090
And now it's a bold statement.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,990
But basically there was a steam,

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,290
the engine team and they built this new smart contract

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,189
standard for entities on aetherium.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,689
And basically,

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,689
you can think of it as an enhancement of erc721

12
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,389
or a superset of the template.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,590
That was erc721.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,389
Now,

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,790
why is it a superset of erc721?

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,189
Well,

17
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,790
first of all,

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,990
it's cheaper because you can hold asset classes,

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,490
it.

20
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,090
No longer tracks singular ownership on erc721.

21
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,890
You interact with a contract and it tracked ownership of

22
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,390
each individual piece.

23
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,690
What this meant was that if you had.

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,290
And if he's on an erc721 contract,

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,390
let's say you own five assets.

26
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,490
If you wanted to transfer those assets,

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,490
you would have to transfer those assets one by one,

28
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,890
right?

29
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,890
And so doing that.

30
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,390
Buy one,

31
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,390
you're paying fees on each individual transaction.

32
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,489
And er c1155.

33
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,390
You can hold asset classes.

34
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,490
So if you if you buy 10 and if tease

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,789
of you know,

36
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,690
let's say you buy 10 digital art pieces from the

37
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,089
same project.

38
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,789
Now in,

39
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,089
ER c1155,

40
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,190
you can hold all of those 10 together and you

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,390
can sell them together.

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,690
You can transfer them together.

43
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,190
It's cheaper.

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,890
You don't have to pay as many Gatsby's going back

45
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,289
and forth because you can sell them in bulk.

46
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,089
There's a lot of enhancements,

47
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,089
but it's a super said,

48
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,089
because you can also create an erc721 acid inside

49
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,490
of a smart contract.

50
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:38,690
That is,

51
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:38,890
er,

52
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,990
c1155.

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,089
This is a complicated mechanism for saying that they're complimentary.

54
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,390
Basically,

55
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,890
they're complimentary.

56
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,089
They're not competition.

57
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,990
Erc721 can support our c1155 but ER c1155

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,990
the smart contract,

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,990
pipe and support.

60
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,690
Assets of this time.

61
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,390
And so with that,

62
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,089
what you need to know here is that this is

63
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,089
the current standard.

64
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,690
This is where it started.

65
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,390
This is where it's going.

66
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,690
And by knowing that you can,

67
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,590
deep dive a bit deeper into all of the aspects.

68
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,990
I can go into it and I will be linking

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,290
the docks to the standard CR c1155 so you can

70
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,790
read a bit deeper about it.

71
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,990
But at the end of the day this is what

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,390
most marketplaces are running on right now and how asset

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,690
classes are kind of divvied up.

74
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,390
Right?

75
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,590
We we we want things to be cheaper,

76
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,290
faster smarter,

77
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,490
cuz the theorem can cost a lot of money when

78
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,890
you're paying these gas fees,

79
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,190
to transfer things and erc721 did a lot of good

80
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,490
things,

81
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,990
but the enhancements that come from 1155 far,

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,390
outweigh the benefits of 7:00,

83
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,690
to 1.

84
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,290
And that's where the trickiness lies.

85
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,190
But basically,

86
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,790
this is the Smart contract type that is now powering

87
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,990
the majority of transactions around,

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,390
and if he's on a theorem and now,

89
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,690
What we need to know here.

90
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,890
That is the Crux of it all.
